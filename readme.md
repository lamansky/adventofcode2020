# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions

These are my solutions for the puzzles in the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenge.

Here’s what you would need to do to run the functions to solve the puzzles:

1. Make sure you have Node installed.
2. Clone the Git repository.
3. Put your input for the day into a file called `input.txt` in the appropriate day’s folder.
4. Run the `solve` command from the terminal in the project’s root directory.

The terminal command will look like this:

```bash
npx . solve 1 1
```

The `solve` command has two parameters. The first number is the number of the day, and the second number is the number of the puzzle for that day (either 1 or 2). The terminal command given above will solve the first puzzle for the first day. You can omit the second parameter to run both puzzles for the indicated day.
